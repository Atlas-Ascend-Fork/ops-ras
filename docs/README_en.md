### Guide Documents

| Document                                                         | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Source Code Build Guide](en/install/compile.md)                        | Introduces different source code build methods and verification methods in online and offline scenarios.          |
| [Operator Invocation Guide](en/invocation/quick_op_invocation.md)         | Introduces the method of invoking operator samples and different operator invocation methods (such as aclnn/graph, and so on).     |
| [Standard Operator Development Guide](en/develop/aicore_develop_guide.md)       | Introduces how to define operator prototypes and implement Tiling and Kernel based on standard engineering. Such operators are called "standard operators".<br>Standard operators support aclnn and graph mode invocation. |
| [Simple Operator Development Guide](../examples/fast_kernel_launch_example/README.md) | Introduces how to implement fast_kernel_launch based on simple engineering, that is, the `<<<>>>` method. Such operators are called "simple operators".<br>Simple operators only support PyTorch invocation. |
| [Operator Debugging and Tuning](en/debug/op_debug_prof.md)                    | Introduces common operator function debugging and performance tuning methods (such as data collection and simulation pipeline, and so on). |

### API Documents

| Document        | Description                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [Operator List](en/op_list.md)                        | Introduces the list of all operators included in the project.                                 |
| [aclnn List](en/op_api_list.md)                   | Introduces the list of all operator aclnn APIs included in the project. To facilitate users to invoke operators on the Host side, C language APIs are provided, that is, APIs with the aclnn prefix. |

### Tool Documents

| Document        | Description                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [Simulator Tool](en/debug/cann_sim.md) | A SoC-level simulation tool for operator development scenarios, used to analyze the precision and performance data of AI tasks running on the AI simulator at each stage. |
