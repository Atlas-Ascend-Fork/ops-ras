# Operator Interfaces (aclnn)

## Usage Instructions

To facilitate operator invocation, a set of C-based APIs (prefixed with aclnn) is provided. These APIs do not require IR (Intermediate Representation) definitions, making it convenient and efficient to build models and develop applications. This method is called "single operator API invocation," abbreviated as aclnn invocation.

When calling operator APIs, you need to reference the dependent header files and library files. Generally, the header files are located by default at `${INSTALL_DIR}/include/aclnnop`, and the library files are located by default at `${INSTALL_DIR}/lib64`. The specific files are as follows:

- Dependent header files: (1) Method 1 (Recommended): Reference the operator aggregate header file `aclnn_ops_${ops_project}.h`. (2) Method 2: Reference individual operator API header files `aclnn_*.h` as needed.
- Dependent library files: Reference the operator aggregate library file `libopapi_${ops_project}.so` as needed. Note that the original aggregate library file `libopapi.so` for all operator repositories will be deprecated in the future. It is not recommended for use, and it does not support simultaneous use with individual operator repository files.

Here, `${INSTALL_DIR}` represents the path where CANN is installed, and `${ops_project}` represents the operator repository name (such as ras, nn, math). Configure it to the actual operator repository name.

- **V Version Evolution Description**

  Note that some APIs have multiple V versions. When using them, select the highest V version (higher-version APIs already include all the capabilities of lower-version APIs).

## Interface List

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Operator feature introduction: Before invoking APIs, please first learn the basic knowledge of operators, including **deterministic algorithms**, **Batch consistency**, and **common quantization modes**. For details, see [Basic Operator Concepts](context/basic_concept.md).
> - Symbol description: The "-" symbol in the table indicates that the interface does not currently support the product in that column.

The operator interface list is as follows:

|    Interface Name   |      Description     |    Determinism Description (A2/A3)    |    Determinism Description (Ascend 950)    |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
| [aclnnObfuscationCalculate](../../reliability/obfuscation_calculate/docs/aclnnObfuscationCalculate.md) | Sends the tensor x and configuration parameters (such as param, cmd) to the PMCC obfuscation engine. The CA module of the engine calls the TA module to perform tensor obfuscation processing, and finally returns an obfuscated tensor y with the same shape as x. |Default deterministic implementation| - |
| [aclnnObfuscationCalculateV2](../../reliability/obfuscation_calculate/docs/aclnnObfuscationCalculateV2.md) | Sends the tensor x and configuration parameters (such as param, cmd) to the PMCC obfuscation engine. The CA module of the engine calls the TA module to perform tensor obfuscation processing, and finally returns an obfuscated tensor y with the same shape as x. |Default deterministic implementation| - |
| [aclnnObfuscationSetup](../../reliability/obfuscation_setup/docs/aclnnObfuscationSetup.md) | Completes the resource initialization and release of the PMCC model obfuscation engine. |Default deterministic implementation| - |
| [aclnnObfuscationSetupV2](../../reliability/obfuscation_setup/docs/aclnnObfuscationSetupV2.md) | Completes the resource initialization and release of the PMCC model obfuscation engine. |Default deterministic implementation| - |
| [aclnnCrypto](../../reliability/crypto/docs/aclnnCrypto.md) | Calls the aicpu encryption/decryption operator and executes according to the input parameters. |Default deterministic implementation| - |
| [aclnnMatmulAbftVerify](../../reliability/matmul_abft_verify/docs/aclnnMatmulAbftVerify_en.md) | Performs V-ABFT fault detection on a precomputed matrix multiplication result and outputs per-row detection results. |Default deterministic implementation| -  |
